# Hypertension Risk Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts the risk of hypertension using Python and machine learning techniques.

# Dataset
The dataset includes 13 attributes, covering demographic and health-related factors such as:
1. Demographics: Gender, age.
2. Lifestyle Factors: Smoking habits, daily cigarette consumption.
3. Health Metrics: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, heart rate, glucose levels, and cholesterol.
4. Medical History: Diabetes, use of blood pressure medications (BPMeds).
5. Target Variable: Hypertension risk (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk).
   
# Objectives
1. Identify factors contributing to hypertension risk based on health and lifestyle data.
2. Provide data-driven recommendations for preventive interventions.
3. Build predictive models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to assess hypertension risk, evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
