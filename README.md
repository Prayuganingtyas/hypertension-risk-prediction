# hypertension-risk-prediction
This project analyzes and predicts the risk of hypertension using Python and machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset includes 13 attributes, covering demographic and health-related factors such as:

Demographics: Gender, age.
Lifestyle Factors: Smoking habits, daily cigarette consumption.
Health Metrics: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, heart rate, glucose levels, and cholesterol.
Medical History: Diabetes, use of blood pressure medications (BPMeds).
Target Variable: Hypertension risk (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk).
Objectives
Identify factors contributing to hypertension risk based on health and lifestyle data.
Provide data-driven recommendations for preventive interventions.
Build predictive models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to assess hypertension risk, evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
